Digital Krushi Consultancy


This web-based platform was developed to help farmers receive guidance and support from agriculture experts
online. It aims to solve common farming issues by offering expert advice, crop management tips, government
scheme details, and training materials like videos and articlesall in one place.The application is designed to be userfriendly
so even farmers with basic digital knowledge can use it. I worked on both the frontend and backend. For
the frontend, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. On the backend, I used Spring Boot and ASP.NET MVC
to handle data and application logic. MySQL was used to store data such as farmer details and queries, and REST
APIs were used to connect the frontend with the backend smoothly.
